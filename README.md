# dash-arcgis-open

Open Source implementation of Plotly Dash mapping components, powered by the ESRI ArcGIS API for Javascript.

## DISCLAIMER

**This library is not in any way affiliated with either ESRI or Plotly.**

This is simply the result of a programmer frustrated by the decision to make Dash ArcGIS a part of the pay-to-use Dash Enterprise. I am Far from a react expert so contributions are more than welcome.
